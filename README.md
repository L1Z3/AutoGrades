AutoGrades

A script that automatically pulls from Canvas server my grades, and plots the changes over time on a graph. I don't document this (or any of my projects, really) very well, so try to figure out how it works at your own risk.

Note: there were many changes made before I began tracking changes on GitHub. Initial files commit is the last version before I started tracking changes
